# Observability in Your Application

One of the fundamental things that changes with serverless applications is how we observe them. In many respects, they force you to be more disciplined. There is no server or container that we your connect to in order to review logs, or look at network connections, or run local tracing. You have to build this in at the start.

There are three pillars of observability - logging, metrics, and traces. The application you've deployed has mechanisms to emit all three.

## Logging

## Metrics

## Tracing
